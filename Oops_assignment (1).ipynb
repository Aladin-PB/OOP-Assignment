        "1. What is Object-Oriented programming language ?\n",
        "- Ans : Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods. It is a technique based on a mathematical discipline, called “abstract data types,” for storing data with the procedures needed to process that data. OOP offers the potential to evolve programming to a higher level of abstraction.\n",

        "- Ans : Polymorphism, derived from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morph\" (form), refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Python, this concept allows you to use a single interface to represent different types, enabling code to be more flexible and reusable.\n",

        "3. **Duck Typing:**\n",
        "Python uses duck typing, which means that the type of an object is less important than the methods it supports.\n",
        "If an object has a method that is called, it will work, regardless of the type of the object.\n",

        "- Ans: In Python, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts direct access to some components, which helps protect the integrity of the data and ensures proper usage.\n",
